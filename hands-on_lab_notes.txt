Description
    Lab Overview
        Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed Docker container registry that helps you store, manage, 
        and deploy Docker container images.  ECR is integrated with Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS), streamlining your 
        development and deployment operations. You can use Amazon's other services such as Simple Storage Service (S3) and 
        Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control and manage your entire container-based solution. In this Lab you will 
        build two Docker container images with Amazon CodeBuild, push the images to ECR, and perform a blue-green deployment 
        operation using ECS.

Lab Objectives
    Upon completion of this Lab you will be able to:

    Use application source files to create Docker container images and place them in Amazon ECR.
    Create an Amazon ECS cluster.
    Use the Amazon ECR images to create task definitions and services.
    Implement the services in ECS container instances and adjust instance numbers.
    Register ECS container instances with an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
    Switch from one deployed application to another quickly and with no downtime.

Lab Prerequisites
    You should be familiar with:

    Basic understanding of local operating system and computer use.
    An understanding of Docker and container concepts is helpful, but not required.
